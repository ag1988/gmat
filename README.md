## GMAT: Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers

This repository contains the accompanying code for the paper:

**"GMAT: Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers."** Ankit Gupta and Jonathan Berant. 
[[PDF]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03274.pdf)

We will be releasing the code only after a couple of months as we are working on some more applications of GMAT and are sorry for the delay.
